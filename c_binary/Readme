how to simulate:
#1: run tsav control server (./tsav_ctrl ../mqtt_broker.cfg)
#2: run train code [train 1] (./mqtt_client_trial ../train1.cfg ../mqtt_broker.cfg)
#3: run train code [train 2] (./mqtt_client_trial ../train2.cfg ../mqtt_broker.cfg)

config files:

#1: mqtt_broker_server.cfg <stores broker server url includingport info>
sample broker server contents(below):
tcp://broker.hivemq.com:1883

#2: train.cfg <stores route id(rid), location(loc). train id(tid), velocity and direction.

sample train config contents below:
rid=63
loc=15
tid=1005
velocity=60
direction=1

config file explanations:
rid: any integer value (trains shoudl run on same route(rid) to simulate collision avoidance)
loc: location can have fixed values from 1 to 15.
tid: integer value (unique train id)
velocity: interger value between (0 to 60)
direction: 1(up) or 0(down).
